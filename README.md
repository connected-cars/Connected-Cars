# Connected-Cars
This repository was created to manage project tasks.

This Project will be conducted in colloboration with ROKETSAN A.Åž.

In the recent years, the need of self connected cars has become an important topic of research. Along with connected cars, IOT and deep learning research topics have also aroused. This project is designed to cover basic design constraints of a complicated system architecture. 

Within this design ; there will be two self driving autonomous cars. Connected Car #1 (CC1) will first find the route to the exit point through some labyrinth using various sensors. Once the correct route is recorded, connected car number #2 (CC2) will ask CC1 for the proper route and reach to the same exit point.
